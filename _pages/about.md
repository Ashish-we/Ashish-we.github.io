I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at [Old Dominion University](https://www.odu.edu), Norfolk, VA. My research focuses on **Explainable AI (XAI)** and **Hypothesis-driven AI** for biomedical research.

I am particularly interested in the intersection of large language models (LLMs) and genomics. My current work involves leveraging foundational models like **scGPT** and **Geneformer** to analyze single-cell genomics data, specifically for Alzheimer's disease research (using ROSMAP data). I am also exploring the application of transformer architectures to modeling and understanding biological sequences.

Beyond my core research, I have a strong foundation in deep learning and transformer architectures, with a particular focus on understanding their mathematical foundations.

### Research Interests

- **Single-Cell Genomics:** Applying foundational models to scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data.
- **Explainable AI:** Developing transparent models for biomedical decision-making.
- **LLM Architectures:** Investigating classification heads, tokenization strategies, and attention mechanisms.

### Technical Skills

- **Languages:** Python, PHP, JavaScript, C, C++, SQL.
- **AI / ML:** PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas, Jupyter.
- **Web Development:** HTML/CSS, Laravel.

### Current Projects

- **Alzheimer's Disease Analysis:** Leveraging Deep Learning (including LLMs) and other Machine Learning models for Alzheimer's disease prediction using ROSMAP data.
<!-- - **LLM Architectures:** Comparative analysis of classification heads for single-cell foundational models. -->
